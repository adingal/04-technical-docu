                    <p>Microsoft Access is a database management system (DBMS) from Microsoft that combines the relational
                        Microsoft Jet Database Engine with a graphical user interface and software-development tools. It is
                        a member of the Microsoft Office suite of applications, included in the Professional and higher editions
                        or sold separately.</p>

                    <p>Microsoft Access stores data in its own format based on the Access Jet Database Engine. It can also import
                        or link directly to data stored in other applications and databases.</p>

                    <p>Software developers, data architects and power users can use Microsoft Access to develop application software.
                        Like other Microsoft Office applications, Access is supported by Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), an
                        object-based
                        programming language that can reference a variety of objects including DAO (Data Access Objects), ActiveX Data
                        Objects,
                        and many other ActiveX components. Visual objects used in forms and reports expose their methods and properties
                        in the
                        VBA programming environment, and VBA code modules may declare and call Windows operating system operations.</p>

                    <header>History</header> 
                    <p>Prior to the introduction of Access, Borland (with Paradox and dBase) and Fox (with FoxPro) dominated the desktop
                        database
                        market. Microsoft Access was the first mass-market database program for Windows. With Microsoft's purchase of
                        FoxPro in 1992
                        and the incorporation of Fox's Rushmore query optimization routines into Access, Microsoft Access quickly became
                        the dominant
                        database for Windows - effectively eliminating the competition which failed to transition from the MS-DOS world.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Timeline</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1992: Microsoft released Access version 1.0 on November 13, 1992, and an Access 1.1 release in May 1993 to
                            improve compatibility
                            with other Microsoft products and to include the Access Basic programming language.</li>

                        <li>1994: Microsoft specified the minimum hardware requirements for Access v2.0 as: Microsoft Windows v3.1 with
                            4 MB of RAM required,
                            6 MB RAM recommended; 8 MB of available hard disk space required, 14 MB hard disk space recommended. The
                            product shipped on seven
                            1.44 MB diskettes. The manual shows a 1994 copyright date.</li>

                        <li>With Office 95, Microsoft Access 7.0 (a.k.a. "Access 95") became part of the Microsoft Office Professional
                            Suite, joining Microsoft
                            Excel, Word, and PowerPoint and transitioning from Access Basic to VBA. Since then, Microsoft has released
                            new versions of Microsoft
                            Access with each release of Microsoft Office. This includes Access 97 (version 8.0), Access 2000 (version
                            9.0), Access 2002 (version 10.0),
                            Access 2003 (version 11.5), Access 2007 (version 12.0), Access 2010 (version 14.0), and Access 2013 (version
                            15.0).</li>

                        <li>Versions 3.0 and 3.5 of Microsoft Jet database engine (used by Access 7.0 and the later-released Access 97
                            respectively) had a critical
                            issue which made these versions of Access unusable on a computer with more than 1 GB of memory.[22] While
                            Microsoft fixed this problem for
                            Jet 3.5/Access 97 post-release, it never fixed the issue with Jet 3.0/Access 95.</li>

                        <li>The native Access database format (the Jet MDB Database) has also evolved over the years. Formats include
                            Access 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97,
                            2000, 2002, and 2007. The most significant transition was from the Access 97 to the Access 2000 format;
                            which is not backward compatible with
                            earlier versions of Access. As of 2011 all newer versions of Access support the Access 2000 format. New
                            features were added to the Access 2002
                            format which can be used by Access 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2010.</li>

                        <li>Microsoft Access 2000 increased the maximum database size to 2GB from 1GB in Access 97.</li>

                        <li>Microsoft Access 2007 introduced a new database format: ACCDB. It supports links to SharePoint lists and
                            complex data types such as multivalue
                            and attachment fields. These new field types are essentially recordsets in fields and allow the storage of
                            multiple values or files in one field.
                            Microsoft Access 2007 also introduced File Attachment field, which stored data more efficiently than the OLE
                            (Object Linking and Embedding) field.</li>

                        <li>Microsoft Access 2010 introduced a new version of the ACCDB format supported hosting Access Web solutions on
                            a SharePoint 2010 server. For the
                            first time, this allowed Access solutions to be run without having to install Access on their PC and was the
                            first support of Mac users. Any user
                            on the SharePoint site with sufficient rights could use the Access Web solution. A copy of Access was still
                            required for the developer to create
                            the Access Web solution, and the desktop version of Access remained part of Access 2010. The Access Web
                            solutions were not the same as the desktop
                            solutions. Automation was only through the macro language (not VBA) which Access automatically converted to
                            JavaScript. The data was no longer in
                            an Access database but SharePoint lists. An Access desktop database could link to the SharePoint data, so
                            hybrid applications were possible so that
                            SharePoint users needing basic views and edits could be supported while the more sophisticated, traditional
                            solutions could remain in the desktop
                            Access database.</li>

                        <li>Microsoft Access 2013 offers traditional Access desktop solutions plus a significantly updated SharePoint
                            2013 web solution. The Access Web
                            model in Access 2010 was replaced by a new architecture that stores its data in actual SQL Server databases.
                            Unlike SharePoint lists, this offers true
                            relational database design with referential integrity, scalability, extensibility and performance one would
                            expect from SQL Server. The database
                            solutions that can be created on SharePoint 2013 offer a modern user interface designed to display multiple
                            levels of relationships that can be viewed
                            and edited, along with resizing for different devices and support for touch. The Access 2013 desktop is
                            similar to Access 2010 but several features were
                            discontinued including support for Access Data Projects (ADPs), pivot tables, pivot charts, Access data
                            collections, source code control, replication,
                            and other legacy features.[25] Access desktop database maximum size remained 2GB (as it has been since the
                            2000 version).</li>

                    <header>Uses</header> 
                    <p>In addition to using its own database storage file, Microsoft Access also may be used as the 'front-end' of a
                        program while other products act as the
                        'back-end' tables, such as Microsoft SQL Server and non-Microsoft products such as Oracle and Sybase. Multiple
                        backend sources can be used by a Microsoft
                        Access Jet Database (ACCDB and MDB formats). Similarly, some applications such as Visual Basic, ASP.NET, or
                        Visual Studio .NET will use the Microsoft
                        Access database format for its tables and queries. Microsoft Access may also be part of a more complex solution,
                        where it may be integrated with other
                        technologies such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint and ActiveX
                        controls.</p>

                    <p>Access tables support a variety of standard field types, indices, and referential integrity including cascading
                        updates and deletes. Access also includes
                        a query interface, forms to display and enter data, and reports for printing. The underlying Jet database, which
                        contains these objects, is multi-user and
                        handles record-locking.</p>

                    <p>Repetitive tasks can be automated through macros with point-and-click options. It is also easy to place a
                        database on a network and have multiple users
                        share and update data without overwriting each other's work. Data is locked at the record level which is
                        significantly different from Excel which locks the
                        entire spreadsheet.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="main-section p-4 mb-2" id="Features">
                    <header>Features</header> 
                    <p>Users can create tables, queries, forms and reports, and connect them together with macros. Advanced users can
                        use VBA to write rich solutions with advanced
                        data manipulation and user control. Access also has report creation features that can work with any data source
                        that Access can access.</p>

                    <p>Sample VBA "hello world" using MsgBox and variable naming convention:</p>

                    <div class="p-2 mb-3">
                        <code>MsgBox "Hello, world!"</code><br>
                        <code>Dim strName as String</code><br>
                        <code>Dim lngPrice as Long</code><br>
                        <code>Dim boolMarried as Boolean</code><br>
                        <code>Dim objAccess as Object</code>
                    </div>

                    <p>The original concept of Access was for end users to be able to access data from any source. Other features
                        include: the import and export of data to many formats
                        including Excel, Outlook, ASCII, dBase, Paradox, FoxPro, SQL Server and Oracle. It also has the ability to link
                        to data in its existing location and use it for
                        viewing, querying, editing, and reporting. This allows the existing data to change while ensuring that Access
                        uses the latest data. It can perform heterogeneous
                        joins between data sets stored across different platforms. Access is often used by people downloading data from
                        enterprise level databases for manipulation, analysis,
                        and reporting locally.</p>
